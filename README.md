# epvpn\_xml2vcard
For [micropoc](https://micropoc.de): Takes the XML file you've downloaded before and generates a vCard (makes sense for Android and stuff).


## Usage

1. Get your brandnew™ XML file from the [micropoc Phonebook](https://micropoc.de/phonebook.xml). Maybe save it as `phonebook.xml`.
2. If not already done, set executable rights for the program through `chmod +x micropoc_xml2vcard`.
3. Run `./micropoc_xml2vcard -i phonebook.xml -o micropoc.vcf`.
4. Now you have a file named `micropoc.vcf` ready to import to Android™®©đ€¶@ŋŧ¶ or somewhere else.
